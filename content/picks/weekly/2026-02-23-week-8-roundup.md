## Week 8 Recap

What a week! We went **8-4** overall, pushing our monthly record to **32-18**. The highlights:

### NFL (4-2)

The NFL playoffs continue to be our bread and butter. Our Chiefs spread pick hit comfortably, and the under in the NFC game cashed with room to spare. The two losses came on a bad beat in the late-window game and a divisional round upset.

### NBA (4-2)

Saturday was the standout — we went a perfect **3-0** on our NBA card. The Lakers over hit with ease, and both our spread picks covered by double digits. The two losses came midweek on a pair of close games that could have gone either way.

### Looking Ahead

Week 9 brings a loaded NFL conference championship slate and a packed NBA schedule. We'll have daily picks posted every morning by 10 AM ET. Stay locked in.
