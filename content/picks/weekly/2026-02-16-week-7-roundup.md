## Week 7 Recap

A break-even-ish week at **6-5**, but the bankroll stays healthy. Let's break it down.

### NFL (2-1)

Divisional round action gave us two solid wins on spread plays. The lone loss was a total that went over by half a point — brutal, but that's the game.

### NBA (1-3)

Rough stretch for our NBA picks this week. Injuries derailed two of our plays, and a late collapse cost us the third. The lone win was our high-confidence Celtics pick.

### NHL (3-1)

The ice was kind to us this week. Three moneyline plays cashed, including a nice +140 underdog hit on the Oilers. Our only loss was a total play that missed by one goal.

### Looking Ahead

We bounce back. Week 8 has a great slate and we're locked in on several high-confidence plays already.
