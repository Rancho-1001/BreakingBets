## Week 7 Overview

Solid 6-4 week to keep the overall record trending positive. Serie A and ATP Tour picks were the highlights this time around.

## Soccer Highlights

- **EPL: 1-2** — Tottenham ML ✅, Newcastle BTTS ❌, Brighton under 2.5 ❌
- **Serie A: 3-0** — Napoli -1 ✅, Juventus under 2.5 ✅, AC Milan BTTS ✅
- **Bundesliga: 1-1** — Bayern over 3.5 ✅, Dortmund ML ❌

Serie A was our bread and butter this week. Italian football's tactical nature makes it prime territory for under/over analysis, and our models nailed the defensive matchups.

## Tennis Highlights

- **ATP: 1-1** — Sinner ML ✅, Medvedev -4.5 games ❌

Mixed bag on the ATP side. Sinner continues to be a reliable pick on hard courts, while Medvedev's inconsistency burned the games spread.

## Looking Ahead

WTA Qatar Open kicks off next week alongside a loaded EPL and La Liga fixture list. UCL Round of 16 first legs are on the horizon.
