## Analysis

The Lakers and Celtics always deliver when they meet, and this matchup should be no different. Both teams rank in the top 10 in offensive rating and have been trending up in pace over the last two weeks.

### Key Factors

- **Pace of Play**: Both teams have played at an above-average pace in their last five games, averaging over 100 possessions per game.
- **Defensive Concerns**: Boston is missing a key perimeter defender, which should open up the Lakers' transition game.
- **Rivalry Factor**: These two teams always play with extra intensity, leading to more possessions and free throws.

### The Pick

Take the **Over 224.5** at -105. With both teams firing on all cylinders offensively and questionable defensive intensity, expect a high-scoring affair.
