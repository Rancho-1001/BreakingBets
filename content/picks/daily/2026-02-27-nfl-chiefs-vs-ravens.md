## Analysis

The Kansas City Chiefs head into this AFC Championship matchup as slight favorites, and for good reason. Their defensive front has been dominant in the postseason, recording 12 sacks over the last three playoff games.

### Key Factors

- **Chiefs Pass Rush**: Chris Jones and the defensive line have been virtually unblockable, and Baltimore's offensive line has struggled against interior pressure all season.
- **Mahomes in Playoffs**: Patrick Mahomes owns a 14-3 postseason record. His ability to extend plays and create magic in the pocket is unmatched.
- **Weather Factor**: Expected temps in the mid-30s favor Kansas City's power run game over Baltimore's speed-based offense.

### The Pick

Take the **Chiefs -3.5** at -110. Kansas City's playoff pedigree and defensive dominance make them the play here. Expect a hard-fought game that the Chiefs pull away in late.
