## Match Overview

Borussia Dortmund host RB Leipzig at the Signal Iduna Park in a top-of-the-table Bundesliga clash. The Yellow Wall will be in full voice for what promises to be an end-to-end affair.

## Key Factors

**Dortmund** have been involved in 3+ goal games in 9 of their last 11 home matches. Their attacking talent is elite, but defensive lapses continue to plague them, making their matches consistently high-scoring.

**RB Leipzig** play the most aggressive pressing game in the Bundesliga. They force turnovers and transition quickly, but this leaves them exposed at the back — 14 goals conceded in their last 8 away matches.

## The Pick: Over 3.5 Goals (+105)

At plus money, this is excellent value. Over 3.5 has hit in 6 of the last 8 meetings between these sides. Both teams play an open, attacking style that creates chaos. Dortmund's home matches average 3.8 goals this season.

## Risk Assessment

The plus-money line reflects that 3.5 is a high threshold, but the stylistic matchup overwhelmingly favors goals. This is the Bundesliga's most entertaining fixture for a reason. Confidence level: **Moderate**.
