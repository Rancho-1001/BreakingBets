## Match Overview

The North London side welcomes Chelsea to the Emirates in a pivotal Premier League Sunday fixture. Arsenal sit top of the table and have been near-flawless at home, while Chelsea's away record against the top 6 has been underwhelming.

## Key Factors

**Arsenal** are unbeaten in their last 14 home league matches, winning 12 of them. Their defensive solidity at the Emirates is elite — just 7 goals conceded at home all season. The high press and set-piece threat have been devastating.

**Chelsea** have lost 4 of their last 6 away matches against top-half sides. Their midfield has struggled to control games on the road, and they've conceded first in 5 of their last 7 away fixtures.

## The Pick: Arsenal -0.5 Asian Handicap (-120)

Arsenal at home in a derby are a different beast. The -0.5 AH is essentially a win bet, and at -120 this is solid value. Arsenal have won this fixture at the Emirates in 4 of the last 5 meetings, and the current form gap between the two sides at home/away is significant.

## Risk Assessment

Chelsea could park the bus and play for a draw, but Arsenal's set-piece prowess and ability to break down low blocks have been elite this season. Confidence level: **Strong**.
