## Match Overview

A blockbuster ATP Dubai Open semifinal pits the veteran champion Novak Djokovic against the young gun Carlos Alcaraz. Their rivalry has produced some of the best tennis in recent years.

## Key Factors

**Djokovic** is 15-2 on hard courts this season and always raises his level in big matches. His ability to grind out long rallies and find winners under pressure remains elite.

**Alcaraz** has won 3 of his last 4 meetings against Djokovic, and his aggressive baseline game has been particularly effective on outdoor hard courts. He's dropped just one set en route to the semis.

## The Pick: Alcaraz ML (+110)

At plus money, Alcaraz represents strong value. His recent head-to-head dominance, faster court speed, and physical edge in longer rallies all point his way. The outdoor hard court conditions in Dubai suit his power game perfectly.

## Risk Assessment

Djokovic in knockout rounds is never easy to bet against, but the plus-money line on Alcaraz is too good to ignore given recent form. Confidence level: **Strong**.
