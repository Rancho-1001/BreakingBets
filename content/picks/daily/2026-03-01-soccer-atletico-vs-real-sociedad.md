## Match Overview

Atletico Madrid host Real Sociedad at the Civitas Metropolitano. Simeone's side are chasing a top-3 finish, while Sociedad are battling for a European spot. This has all the makings of a tight, tactical affair.

## Key Factors

**Atletico Madrid** remain the masters of the low-scoring game. Their home matches this season average just 1.8 total goals, and they've kept 8 clean sheets at the Metropolitano. The defensive structure under Simeone is as disciplined as ever.

**Real Sociedad** have struggled for goals on the road, scoring just 0.8 goals per away match this season. Their creative outlets have been inconsistent, and they often sit deep against the stronger home sides.

## The Pick: Under 2.5 Goals (-105)

Under 2.5 has hit in 7 of Atletico's last 10 home matches and 8 of Sociedad's last 10 away matches. When you combine Simeone's defensive DNA with Sociedad's away scoring woes, this line feels like a lock.

## Risk Assessment

Atletico could blow the game open early, but their tendency is to control the tempo and grind out 1-0 or 2-0 wins. Sociedad lack the firepower to force open games on the road. Confidence level: **Strong**.
