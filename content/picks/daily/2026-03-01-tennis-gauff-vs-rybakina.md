## Match Overview

The WTA Qatar Open final pits American star Coco Gauff against the powerful Elena Rybakina. Both players have been in excellent form, and their contrasting styles should produce a compelling final.

## Key Factors

**Gauff** has improved her serve dramatically and her court coverage remains among the best on tour. She's won her semifinal and quarterfinal in three sets, showing her ability to grind through tough matches.

**Rybakina** possesses one of the biggest serves in women's tennis. Her flat groundstrokes can overwhelm opponents, but she can also go through cold spells where her error count rises.

## The Pick: Over 21.5 Games (-105)

These two are evenly matched and both hold serve well. Their previous meetings have gone to three sets, and the over 21.5 has landed in 3 of their last 4 encounters. A scoreline like 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 (30 games) is the most likely outcome.

## Risk Assessment

One player could come out flat and lose a set quickly, but finals between these two typically see both players compete hard on serve. Three sets is the most probable outcome. Confidence level: **Moderate**.
