## Analysis

The Edmonton Oilers head to Denver as underdogs, but they bring one of the most dangerous top lines in hockey. At +130, there's strong value here.

### Key Factors

- **McDavid & Draisaitl**: The duo has combined for 14 points in their last five road games. Colorado's defense has struggled against elite speed.
- **Goaltending Edge**: Edmonton's starter has a .928 save percentage over the last month, among the best in the league.
- **Value Play**: Getting the Oilers at plus money is a gift given their recent form.

### The Pick

Take the **Oilers ML** at +130. This is a value play on a team that's been dominant on the road.
