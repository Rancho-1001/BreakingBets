## Match Overview

Liverpool host Manchester United at Anfield in the most-watched fixture in English football. Both managers have set up their teams to attack, and recent meetings between these sides have been entertaining.

## Key Factors

**Liverpool** have scored 2+ goals in 10 of their last 12 home matches. Anfield under the lights on a Sunday is one of the most intimidating venues in world football, and the front three have been clinical.

**Manchester United** have found their attacking groove in recent weeks, scoring in every match since the turn of the year. However, their defensive frailties remain — they've conceded in 8 of their last 10 away matches.

## The Pick: Over 2.5 Goals (-130)

Over 2.5 has landed in 7 of the last 9 meetings between these sides. Liverpool's attacking firepower at home combined with United's defensive vulnerability makes this a prime over spot. Both teams will push for the win.

## Risk Assessment

The rivalry element could lead to a cagey opening, but the quality in attack on both sides should produce goals. This line has consistently hit in recent history. Confidence level: **Strong**.
