## Match Overview

A heavyweight Champions League Round of 16 tie sees Manchester City welcome Bayern Munich to the Etihad Stadium. Both clubs are synonymous with possession-based, attacking football.

## Key Factors

**Manchester City** have averaged 2.8 goals per home match in the Champions League this season. Their midfield creativity and pressing intensity have been overwhelming opponents at home.

**Bayern Munich** are the Bundesliga's top scorers and have netted 2+ goals in 5 of their 6 UCL group stage matches. Their counter-attacking speed is among the best in Europe.

## The Pick: Over 2.5 Goals (-110)

This line feels generous for two teams that play with attacking intent. Over 2.5 has hit in 4 of City's last 5 UCL home matches and 5 of Bayern's last 6 UCL away matches. The tactical matchup favors an open game.

## Risk Assessment

A cagey first leg is possible if both managers prioritize not conceding, but the quality of attacking players on both sides should produce goals. Confidence level: **Moderate**.
